 In our SDLC Class, we worked on the SNHU Travel application, and we learned a few items during that project. One of those items was gathering and understanding the client's requirements and how to create software to meet those needs. In my career, I have learned this soft skill and tried to teach junior developers on my team. One of the fundamental principles is to listen, really listen. Refrain from thinking about the answer that your client is about to ask. Instead, listen to what they are stating, their need, and their pain point to try to relate yourself to their shoes. The other aspect is to take notes. Please write it down, seriously. If you write something down, your brain will make new neuro-pathways to hold that information longer. Furthermore, because of that, you will then find yourself less likely to forget an essential requirement. Lastly, do not be afraid to ask questions after your initial meeting to ensure you have all the necessary clarifications. 
By starting with these principles, you can apply them to your coding practices and how you interact with team members. By being aware of others, pausing before speaking, or rushing to a conclusion, you will be less likely to make mistakes, create issues with team members, and develop software that meets your client's needs.
